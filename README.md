OkBuy: Gaming protocol/exchange build on top of okx blockchain


## Tech

contract: Solidity Contract deployed using Remix IDE on OKX TestNet

We used dynamic listings to create individual pages for each asset, built on top of next.js, tailwind CSS and web3.js

This has been deployed on Vercel and Vercel Edge

To show our transactions in atomic time, we use the support of OKX Block Explorer (so all transactions are transparent on the blockchain)

asset/dynamic listing: https://okbuy-linker.vercel.app/?id=5
